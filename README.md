#Real-Time Exercise Monitoring System

This is a Flask-based web application that allows users to calculate the number of reps for four types of exercises: curls, pushups, pullups, and squats. The user simply inputs exercise and the app calculates the appropriate number of reps for each exercise based on their inputs.
